    **   MASSIVE UPDATE  ****
    This update changes the models used for vehicles. In order to make it easier
    to integrate QAV with other plugins, models now use Custom Model data tags.
    This means all user-made custom models used in previous versions will need to be upgraded
    Also, the base-item for 1.14+ has been changed to the rabbit-hide, to avoid conflicts with other
    plugins. This does not affect 1.8-1.13, but should be noted for newer servers on 1.14.

    Also, because of this change, all vehicles on 1.14 servers will no longer work.
    I recommend updating only if you wish remove all vehicles from the server first.

    If you wish to use the old 1.13 system on 1.14 still, set "USE_1_13_MODEL_SYSTEM" to true in the config.
    **   MASSIVE UPDATE  ****
